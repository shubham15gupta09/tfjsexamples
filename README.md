# tfjsexamples
here i will be uploading all the examples of tf js
# Notes
1 . These code were provided as a template and I have solved it .<br>
2 . These code require using of Server so as to avoide lot of http request <br>
3 . the script tag should not be included in the body tag to avoid the hang of web . <br>
4 . async and await function were usedso as to make dependencies for the next function . <br>
5 . in some example i have used a pretrained model which were already build so we just have to <br>
    include the link to the same aa script.<br>
6 . Sprite sheets were used for the fashion mnist and the digit classifier as we are dealing with more<br>
    than 70k images and it is a bad idea to call 70k+ times to load images.
